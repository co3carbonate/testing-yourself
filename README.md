#testing-yourself

A convenient online tool that allows you to create tests with questions and answers, test yourself as many times as you like, and finally analyse your past submissions to see where you went wrong.

The aesthetics of this tool is plain and simple; I don't plan on styling it anytime soon.

Hope you find it useful!

Made with HTML, JavaScript, jQuery and PHP.
